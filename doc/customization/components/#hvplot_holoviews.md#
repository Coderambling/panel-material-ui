# hvPlot and HoloViews

hvPlot and HoloViews are probably the two most used plotting libraries with Panel. So its important to know who to style these.

## Light/ Dark mode

To support light and dark mode you will have to ...

```python
import panel as pn
import panel_material_ui as pmu
import polars
import hvplot.polars

BOKEH_THEMES = {
    "dark": "dark_minimal",
    "light": "light_minimal",
}

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv"
df_polars = polars.read_csv(url)

pn.extension()

toggle = pmu.ThemeToggle()

def plot():
    return df_polars.hvplot.scatter(x='bill_length_mm', y='bill_depth_mm', by='species')

holoviews_pane = pn.pane.HoloViews(plot())

pn.Column(
    toggle, holoviews_pane,
).servable()
```

## Fonts

You will have to provide a custom bokeh Theme where all font attributes have been updated.

## Colors

:::note
Unfortunately you cannot style the tooltip or the vertical "selected" tool bar of a hvPlot/ HoloViews/ bokeh plot

### Categorical

When visualizing categorical data each color be visibly distinct from all the other colors, not nearby in color space, to make each category separately visible.

You can find existing categorical color maps [here](https://colorcet.holoviz.org/user_guide/Categorical.html) and [here](https://holoviews.org/user_guide/Colormaps.html#categorical-colormaps)

If you want to create categorical color maps aligned with your Material theme, you can generate them using an online tool like [mycolor](https://mycolor.space/) or use custom Python code.
